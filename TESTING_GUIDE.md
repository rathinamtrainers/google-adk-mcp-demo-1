# üß™ AI Agent Testing Guide

Complete guide to running and testing your deployed AI agent.

---

## ‚ö° Quick Start (30 seconds)

```bash
cd /home/agenticai/google-adk-mcp/agent
./run_agent.sh
```

**Choose an option:**
1. Interactive Chat (talk to the agent)
2. Run Automated Tests (5 test queries)
3. Single Query (ask one question)

---

## üéØ Testing Methods

### Method 1: Easy Menu Script ‚≠ê (Recommended)

```bash
cd /home/agenticai/google-adk-mcp/agent
./run_agent.sh
```

This gives you a menu with 3 options to test your agent.

---

### Method 2: Interactive Chat üí¨

**Best for:** Playing around and testing different questions

```bash
cd /home/agenticai/google-adk-mcp/agent
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/home/agenticai/agentic-ai-batch-2025-bb06223e6daf.json
.venv/bin/python3 chat_with_agent.py
```

**Example conversation:**
```
You: Hi! What is 10 plus 5?
Agent: 10 plus 5 is 15.

You: Calculate 20% of 250
Agent: 20% of 250 is 50.

You: I'm buying 3 shirts at $24.99 each. What's the total?
Agent: The total for 3 shirts at $24.99 each is $74.97.

You: exit
Agent: Goodbye! Have a great day!
```

---

### Method 3: Automated Test Suite ü§ñ

**Best for:** Verifying all features work correctly

```bash
cd /home/agenticai/google-adk-mcp/agent
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/home/agenticai/agentic-ai-batch-2025-bb06223e6daf.json
.venv/bin/python3 test_deployed_agent.py
```

**What it tests:**
- ‚úÖ Simple addition
- ‚úÖ Percentage calculations
- ‚úÖ Discount calculations
- ‚úÖ Square root
- ‚úÖ Price calculations

---

### Method 4: Single Command Query

**Best for:** Quick one-off questions

```bash
cd /home/agenticai/google-adk-mcp/agent
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/home/agenticai/agentic-ai-batch-2025-bb06223e6daf.json

.venv/bin/python3 -c "
from vertexai.agent_engines import AgentEngine
import vertexai

vertexai.init(
    project='agentic-ai-batch-2025',
    location='us-central1',
    staging_bucket='gs://agentic-ai-batch-2025-staging'
)

agent = AgentEngine(
    resource_name='projects/740202511174/locations/us-central1/reasoningEngines/8601228775440515072'
)

response = agent.query(input='What is 7 times 8?')
print(response['output'])
"
```

---

### Method 5: Custom Python Script

Create a file `my_test.py`:

```python
from vertexai.agent_engines import AgentEngine
import vertexai

# Initialize
vertexai.init(
    project="agentic-ai-batch-2025",
    location="us-central1",
    staging_bucket="gs://agentic-ai-batch-2025-staging"
)

# Load agent
agent = AgentEngine(
    resource_name="projects/740202511174/locations/us-central1/reasoningEngines/8601228775440515072"
)

# Your custom tests
my_questions = [
    "What is 100 divided by 5?",
    "Calculate 30% of 90",
    "I want to buy 6 items at $15.50 each. Total?"
]

for q in my_questions:
    response = agent.query(input=q)
    print(f"Q: {q}")
    print(f"A: {response['output']}\n")
```

Run it:
```bash
python3 my_test.py
```

## üìä Performance Testing

### Response Time Test

```python
import time
from vertexai.agent_engines import AgentEngine
import vertexai

vertexai.init(
    project="agentic-ai-batch-2025",
    location="us-central1",
    staging_bucket="gs://agentic-ai-batch-2025-staging"
)

agent = AgentEngine(
    resource_name="projects/740202511174/locations/us-central1/reasoningEngines/8601228775440515072"
)

# Test response time
queries = ["What is 5 + 3?"] * 5

for i, query in enumerate(queries, 1):
    start = time.time()
    response = agent.query(input=query)
    elapsed = time.time() - start
    print(f"Query {i}: {elapsed:.2f}s")
```

### Concurrent Requests Test

```python
import concurrent.futures

def query_agent(question):
    response = agent.query(input=question)
    return response['output']

questions = [
    "What is 10 + 5?",
    "Calculate 20% of 100",
    "What's 8 times 7?",
    "Square root of 81?",
    "15 - 6 = ?"
]

with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3) as executor:
    results = list(executor.map(query_agent, questions))

for q, r in zip(questions, results):
    print(f"Q: {q}\nA: {r}\n")
```

---

## üìà Load Testing

For production readiness, test with increasing loads:

```python
import time

# Simulate 100 queries
for i in range(100):
    response = agent.query(input=f"What is {i} + 1?")
    print(f"Query {i+1}/100 completed")
    time.sleep(0.1)  # Rate limiting
```

---
